train a neural network to summarize news articles.\n","Your neural network is going to learn from example, as we provide you with (article, summary) pairs.\n","We provide you with a **toy dataset** made of only articles about police related news.\n","Usual datasets can be 20x larger in size, but we have reduced it for computational purposes.\n","\n","You will do this using a Transformer network, from the __[Attention is all you need](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf)__ paper.\n","In this assignment you will:\n","- Learn to process text into sub-word tokens, to avoid fixed vocabulary sizes, and UNK tokens.\n","- Implement the key conceptual blocks of a Transformer.\n","- Use a Transformer to read a news article, and produce a summary.\n","- Perform operations on learned word-vectors to examine what the model has learned.\n","\n","    \n","** Before you start **\n","\n","You should read the Attention is all you need paper.\n","We are providing you with skeleton code for the Transformer, but there will have to implement 5 conceptual blocks of the transformer yourself:\n","-  AttentionQKV: the Query, Key, Value attention mechanism at the center of the Transformer\n","- MultiHeadAttention: the multiple heads that enable each input to attend at many places at once.\n","- PositionEmbedding: the sinusoid-based position embedding of the Transformer.\n","- Encoder & Decoder: The encoder (that reads inputs, such as news articles), the decoder (that produces the output summary, one token at a time)\n","- Full Transformer: piecing it all together."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fJVenhu9FLqX"},"source":["All dataset files should be placed in the `dataset/` folder of this assignment.\n","\n","If you are using Google Colab,

The animal had been unaccounted for since the weekend floods destroyed the zoo premises.\n","The man killed, who was 43, worked in a company based in the warehouse, the Ministry of Internal Affairs said. Doctors said he was attacked in the throat and died before reaching the hospital. \n","Experts are still searching the warehouse, the ministry said, adding that earlier reports that the tiger had injured a second man were unfounded. \n","The zoo administration said Wednesday that another tiger was still missing. It was unable to confirm if the creature was dead or had escaped alive.\n","Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili apologized to the public, saying he had been misinformed by the zoo's management when he'd previously said there were no more dangerous animals on the run.\n","City residents were urged to stay indoors for their own safety in the immediate aftermath of the floods. Volunteers have since been helping city workers with the cleanup operation.\n","At least 19 people died in the flooding, according to Civil Georgia, a news website run by the nongovernmental organization United Nations Association of Georgia. Six more remained missing, it said Tuesday, citing the State Security and Crisis Management Council.\n","Meanwhile, the zoo lost about half of its 600 animals, including lions, tigers, bears and wolves, in the natural disaster. \n","Some animals have since been recaptured, Civil Georgia reported. Others died in the floods or have been killed by police as they scour the streets for escapees.\n","Russian state news outlet RT.com  that an African penguin had made it 60 kilometers (37 miles) downriver from Tbilisi before being caught alive in a dragnet on the border with Azerbaijan. \n","Video from the city showed a large crocodile being restrained by rescuers, as well as a hippopotamus standing in floodwaters, looking confused.\n","The latter was eventually cornered in a city square before being tranquilized and recaptured.\n","One terrified bear escaped the flood by perching on a window ledge.\n","Video footage also showed devastation across swaths of the Georgian capital, where flash floods swept away roads, at least one house and many trees. The corpses of dead animals could be seen amid the wreckage.\n","The problems began before midnight Saturday when heavy rainfall turned the Vere River, usually little more than a stream through the center of Tbilisi, into a raging torrent, according to Civil Georgia.\n","Images on Tbilisi City Hall's Facebook page showed roads washed out, hillsides collapsed and vehicles tossed about like toys. Rescue workers carried people on their shoulders through waist-high water.\n","Garibashvili extended his condolences Tuesday to the families of those killed in the flooding.\n","He also proposed the creation of a park in the zoo premises to honor those lost. \"It will be a park of solidarity, a symbol of our unity, selflessness, and mutual support,\" he said in a statement on his website.\n","President Georgi Margvelashvili earlier said the capital's mayoral office would help those who had lost out financially as a result of the floods.\n","\"The situation is difficult, but it can be handled except for the fact that we cannot bring back those who died,\" he said.\n","According to the World Wildlife Fund, as few as 3,200 tigers exist in the wild today.\n","\n","Journalist Eka Kadagishvili reported from Tbilisi, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

shoulder during the execution of a search warrant in the Humboldt Park neighborhood, police say. The alleged shooter, a 19-year-old woman, was in custody. The shooting happened about 7:20 p.m. in the 2700 block of West Potomac Avenue, police said. The officer, part of the Grand Central District tactical unit, was taken to Stroger Hospital. While officers were serving a \\\"typical\\\" search warrant for \\\"narcotics and illegal weapons\\\" and were attempting to reach a rear door, \\\"a shot was fired,\\\" striking the tactical officer in the shoulder, said Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson during a news briefing outside the hospital. He said the officer, who has about four or five years on the job, was \\\"stable\\\" but in critical condition. \\\"His family is here,\\\" Johnson said. \\\"He’s talking a lot and just wants the ordeal to be over.\\\" He said this incident serves as just another reminder of how dangerous a police officer’s job is. At the scene of the shooting, crime tape closed Potomac from Washtenaw Avenue to California Avenue and encompassed the alley west of the brick apartment building, south of Potomac. Dozens of officers stood in the alley, while even more walked up and down the street. Neighbors gathered at the edge of the yellow tape on the sidewalk along California and watched them work. Standing next to a man, a woman talked to police in the crime scene, across the street. \\\"We're not under arrest? We can go?\\\" the woman checked with officers. They told her she could go, and she and the man walked underneath the yellow tape and out of the crime scene.\"\n","input_length = 400\n","output_length = 100\n","\n","# Process the capitalization
